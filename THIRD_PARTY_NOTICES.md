MIT/BSD/Apache components permit use in the GPL application while retaining their
notices. The music, recordings, and fonts are separately identified assets and
keep their own terms. Preserve all accompanying license/credit files with copies;
attribute CC assets, identify changes, honor share-alike for applicable music
adaptations and OFL conditions for fonts. The GPL does not grant rights to privately
imported scores, MIDI files, or recordings. Source licenses and credits, rather
than a composer's age alone, govern the particular bundled edition.

The original decorative header was procedurally commissioned for the project;
generation provenance is in [static/assets/header-art.md](static/assets/header-art.md).
It is distinct from the credited third-party music/audio/font assets.

Before distributing a Python/browser runtime or installer, include the notices
and any corresponding source required by the exact binaries packaged. This
review covers the source checkout and existing bundled assets, not every future
dependency resolution or platform build. See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).
